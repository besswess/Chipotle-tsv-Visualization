# Chipotle-tsv-Visualization

Using python, conduct some exploratory data analysis on Chipotle's order data. You will be looking to answer such questions as:

* How many orders are being made?
* What is the average price per order?
* How many different ingredients?

The Chipotle data set is taken from "The Upshot" column in The New York Times. It was chosen because the data is from a familiar source representing real world consumer transaction data - plus their guacamole is delicious.

This dataset was analyzed in-depth by data scientists from the New York Times. We have modified our questions based on their analysis, but we encourage students not to review their analysis until after they have made their own attempt.
